## Project Context
This project was realized as part of the **"End-to-End Mini Pipeline"** exam.

The objective is to develop a **Machine Learning (NLP)** solution capable of automatically predicting whether a Netflix content (Movie or TV Show) is intended for a **Mature audience** or a **General audience**, by analyzing only its synopsis (*description*).

**Dataset:** [Netflix Movies and TV Shows (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
